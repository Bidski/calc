# CALC
CALC is software for generating convolutional network architectures that closely resemble the architecture of the primate cortex. Each layer in a CALC architecture corresponds with a cell population in the brain, specifically with the group of excitatory cells in a certain layer of a certain cortical area. Hyperparameters are optimized to match primate tract tracing data, cortical area sizes and cell densities, neuron-level in-degrees, and classical receptive field sizes where available. It is a work in progress.

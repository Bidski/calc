# CALC
CALC is software for generating convolutional network architectures that closely resemble the architecture of the primate visual cortex. Each layer in a CALC architecture corresponds with a cell population in the brain, specifically with the group of excitatory cells in a certain layer of a certain cortical area. Hyperparameters are optimized to match primate tract tracing data, cortical area sizes and cell densities, neuron-level in-degrees, and classical receptive field sizes where available. 

CALC was used to develop a convolutional architecture that matches a single hemisphere of the macaque monkey visual cortex, which we call the macaque single-hemisphere (MSH-CALC) model. Connections in this model are summarized in the diagram below. The colour indicates density of the connection. The density measure is the log-FLNe, or fraction of labelled neurons external to the injection site. This is a measure from retrograde tract-tracing studies that was used (among other data) to parameterize the architecture. Some labels are omitted to make the rest of the labels legible, but the model includes separate convolutional layers for cortical layers 2/3, 4, 5, and 6 in each visual area.
